    A Frogger-style game where the player tries to avoid attacks from enemies
while crossing the screen. Levels are completed when the player moves from one
side of the screen to the ather without being killed. Each new level will have
different terrain that affects how fast the player and enemies move, and
more/deadlier enemies.
