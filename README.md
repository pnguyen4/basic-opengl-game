A Frogger-style game where the player tries to avoid attacks from enemies while
crossing the screen. Levels are completed when the player moves from one side of
the screen to the other without being killed. Each new level will have different
terrain that affects how fast the player and enemies move, and more/deadlier 
enemies.

Build Instructions:

- Linux: just use Makefile. Use command "make" while in project folder.

- Windows: Visual Studio should include proper files.

Controls:

- movement: arrow keys

- toggle on/off menu: esc key
